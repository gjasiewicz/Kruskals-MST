**Kruskal’s Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm**

It is a simple implementation of Kruskal’s Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm.

I used my own implementation of FindUnion data structure. 

Additionally I run the experiment, 
I try to verify that expected numbers of edges
used to built MST is n * log n
(I know, that if there are n vertices in the graph 
then each spanning tree has n − 1 edges)

I use the following libraries and toolkits:
* numpy
* matplotlib.pyplot is used for graphics
* the animated gif was created using [ezgif] (https://ezgif.com/)

DEMO EXAMPLE

A process of building minimum spanning tree (MST). 

Given graph has 100 vertices.
